# Redeem Underlying

The redeem underlying function converts aTokens into a specified quantity of the underlying asset, and returns them to the user. The amount of aTokens redeemed is equal to the quantity of underlying tokens received, divided by the current [Exchange Rate](exchange-rate.md). The amount redeemed must be less than the user's [Account Liquidity](https://github.com/annexfinance/annex-docs/tree/294e07fcebce7997c93709b5b9f8bbdb7e8271af/atokens/comptroller/get-account-liquidity.md) and the market's available liquidity.
