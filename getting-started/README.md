# Getting Started

These docs are a comprehensive guide to the Annex protocol, based on the Annex Whitepaper [\(Feb 2021\)](https://annex.finance/documents/Annex.Whitepaper.pdf). The protocol is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/annexfinance/annex-protocol) and maintained by the community.

Please join the \#development room in the Annex community [Discord](https://discord.gg/874ntdw) server; our team, and members of the community, look forward to helping you build an application on top of Annex. Your questions help us improve, so please don't hesitate to ask if you can't find what you are looking for here.
