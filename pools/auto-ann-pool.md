#### Auto ANN

* Stake your ANN into the pool and forget about it! The ANN tokens you staked in this Pool will be automatically compounded (reinvested) for you.
* The “automatic” compounding function is triggered by other users who gets the bouty tokens by claim.
* A small performance fee is subtracted from your earnings each time the pool is automatically compounded.
* An unstaking fee applies when you unstake within 3 days of manually staking.

### What's the best way to use the Auto ANN Pool? <a href="docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520" id="docs-internal-guid-3b1f91a6-7fff-fc76-976a-3a06bada2520"></a>

Stake your ANN, but only withdraw after 72 hours. This way you only pay the performance fee, and not the unstaking fee.

### What’s the Auto ANN bounty?

This bounty is given as a reward for providing a service to other users.

Whenever you successfully claim the bounty, you’re also helping out by activating the Auto ANN Pool's compounding function for everyone as we discussed in above.

Make sure the amount of ANN you receive will be greater than the BNB fees you’ll spend to submit the blockchain transaction!
